# Learn NextJS Basics
 A site to teach how to get started with Next.js

 ## Hosted Here: [https://learn-nextjs-basics-hc0y4mk3c-dickykitchenjr.vercel.app/]

## Purpose: 
- to create a simple walkthrough for people with understanding of React, JS, CSS, and HTML to use to learn the basics of Next.js
- to reinforce my understanding of Next.js as I build the project with Next.js

## Resources Used:
- Next.js
- Next.js docs
- Vercel for deployment
- nextjs-marvel-character-search project I had previously built to demo an aspect of Next.js

### Challenges along the way:
- verifying information through Next.js docs to ensure anyone reading the walkthrough will have a quality understanding of the concepts I've gone over
